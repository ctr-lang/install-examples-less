# Brunch + ctr

__BUG__: `postcss-brunch` and `autoprefixer` for some reson don't prefix the styles, and I don't care enough to figure out why, although, I did look. It's an issue with `postcss-brunch`.

This is a modern JS [skeleton](https://github.com/brunch/with-es6) for Brunch with `ctr`. I've only played around with Brunch a handful of times, but from the [docs](http://brunch.io/docs/getting-started) to a plethora of [skeletons](http://brunch.io/skeletons) and [plugins](http://brunch.io/skeletons) it's elegantly put together and worth a look if you're looking for something simple and quick.
